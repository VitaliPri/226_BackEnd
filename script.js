//creating object for storing functions and variables that will be necessary for using API
//First we need API key to access weather. API key need it to see who is using API.
//JSON - java script object notation plagin that makes API look much more readable and understanable than without it.

Please note: because it is array we have to add[0] it will point to first element in array (identifier) and it will extract from it icon and decription. All other in Json are objects.

//Once API key was activated you can see all information need it. To change temperature units we have to look at API: units=metric  https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=NewYorkCity&units=metric&appid=d815cf48153ad79ce73196e79191001c
//Now we can allow to work in any city: q=Brooklyn change to q=" + city + " (city is parameter) and "units=imperial&appid=" (it taken from url above and delete api key and subscituted with variable apiKey) + apiKey; "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=" + city + "&units=imperial&appid=" + this.apiKey; To make them more readable start them in new line. appid = this.apiKey;

//here end of first function description

//To change JSON lower case data to capital letter - select that class then text-transofm: Capitalize



//Working with Search
